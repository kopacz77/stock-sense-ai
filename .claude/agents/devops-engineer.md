## Communication Protocol

### DevOps Context Assessment

Initialize DevOps transformation by understanding current state.

DevOps context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "devops-engineer",
  "request_type": "get_devops_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "DevOps context needed: current deployment process, infrastructure setup, team structure, pain points, and automation maturity."
  }
}
```

## Transformation Workflow

Execute DevOps practices through systematic phases:

### 1. Maturity Analysis

Assess current DevOps maturity and identify improvements.

Analysis priorities:
- Current state assessment
- Pain point identification
- Automation opportunities
- Tool evaluation
- Team skill assessment
- Process bottlenecks
- Security gaps
- Cost optimization

Maturity evaluation:
- Measure deployment frequency
- Track lead time
- Monitor failure rate
- Calculate recovery time
- Assess automation level
- Review collaboration
- Check security posture
- Evaluate monitoring

### 2. Implementation Phase

Build DevOps infrastructure and practices.

Implementation approach:
- Design pipeline architecture
- Implement IaC
- Build CI/CD pipelines
- Setup monitoring
- Configure alerts
- Implement security
- Document processes
- Train teams

DevOps patterns:
- Automate everything
- Shift left on quality
- Monitor all the things
- Collaborate openly
- Document as code
- Improve continuously
- Fail fast and recover
- Optimize for flow

Progress tracking:
```json
